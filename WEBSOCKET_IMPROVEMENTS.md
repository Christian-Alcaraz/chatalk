# WebSocket Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to both the client-side and server-side WebSocket implementations to fix duplicate message issues and improve connection reliability.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Connection Messages
**Problem**: The client was sending "Client established connection" message on every reconnection, causing duplicate messages.

**Solution**: Added `hasEstablishedConnection` flag to track if the initial connection message has been sent.

### 2. Multiple Event Listeners (Server-side)
**Problem**: Event listeners were being added inside the 'upgrade' event handler, causing multiple listeners to be registered for the same events.

**Solution**: Moved event listeners outside the upgrade handler to prevent duplicates.

### 3. Poor Connection State Management
**Problem**: Reconnection attempts could stack up and cause resource leaks.

**Solution**: Added proper state management with reconnection attempt limits and better cleanup.

## Client-Side Improvements (`ws.service.ts`)

### New Features:
- **Connection State Tracking**: Prevents duplicate connection messages
- **Reconnection Limits**: Maximum of 5 reconnection attempts before giving up
- **Message Type Handling**: Properly handles different message types from server (ack, pong, error, broadcast)
- **Ping Functionality**: Added `sendPing()` method for testing connection health
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling and logging

### Key Methods Added:
- `handleServerMessage(message)`: Handles different types of server messages
- `sendPing()`: Sends ping to server for connection testing
- `resetConnectionState()`: Resets connection state for fresh start

### Connection Flow:
1. First connection → Sends "Client established connection" message
2. Reconnections → Only logs reconnection success, no duplicate messages
3. Manual disconnect → Resets state for clean restart

## Server-Side Improvements (`websocket-app-improved.js`)

### New Features:
- **Map-based Client Pool**: Changed from Set to Map to store more client information
- **Message Type Handling**: Properly handles and responds to different message types
- **Heartbeat/Ping-Pong**: Automatic heartbeat to detect stale connections
- **Stale Connection Cleanup**: Automatically removes inactive connections
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error handling and logging
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on server shutdown

### Key Improvements:
- **No Duplicate Event Listeners**: Event listeners are registered once, not per upgrade request
- **Client Information Tracking**: Stores connection time and last activity for each client
- **Automatic Acknowledgments**: Sends acknowledgment for info messages
- **Connection Validation**: Validates endpoints and prevents duplicate connections
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup of intervals and connections

### Connection Pool Management:
- Stores client info with timestamps
- Automatically removes stale connections (5-minute timeout)
- Tracks last activity for each client
- Provides helper functions for client management

## Message Types Supported

### Client → Server:
- `info`: General information messages
- `ping`: Connection health check
- `request`: Request messages
- `error`: Error reports

### Server → Client:
- `ack`: Acknowledgment of received messages
- `pong`: Response to ping messages
- `error`: Error notifications
- `broadcast`: Messages to all connected clients

## Usage Examples

### Client-side:
```typescript
// Initialize and connect
wsService.setClientWebSocketId('unique-client-id');
wsService.connect();

// Send a message
wsService.sendMessage({
  type: 'info',
  message: 'Hello server'
});

// Test connection
wsService.sendPing();

// Check connection status
if (wsService.isConnected()) {
  console.log('Connected to server');
}

// Disconnect cleanly
wsService.disconnect();
```

### Server-side:
```javascript
// Get active client count
const activeCount = getActiveClientsCount();

// Get specific client info
const clientInfo = getClientInfo('client-id');

// Broadcast to all clients
broadcastToAll({
  type: 'broadcast',
  message: 'Server announcement'
});
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Duplicate Messages**: Connection messages are sent only once
2. **Better Resource Management**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
3. **Improved Reliability**: Automatic reconnection with limits
4. **Better Monitoring**: Enhanced logging and client tracking
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Handles connection failures gracefully
6. **Scalability**: Efficient client pool management

## Configuration

### Client Configuration:
- `RETRY_INTERVAL_IN_SECONDS`: 10 seconds between reconnection attempts
- `MAX_RECONNECT_ATTEMPTS`: 5 maximum reconnection attempts

### Server Configuration:
- `STALE_TIMEOUT`: 5 minutes before cleaning up inactive connections
- `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`: 30 seconds between heartbeat pings

## Migration Notes

To implement these improvements:

1. **Client-side**: Update your `ws.service.ts` with the improved version
2. **Server-side**: Replace your WebSocket server implementation with `websocket-app-improved.js`
3. **Testing**: Test reconnection scenarios to ensure no duplicate messages
4. **Monitoring**: Use the new logging to monitor connection health

The improvements maintain backward compatibility while fixing the duplicate message issues and improving overall connection reliability.
